Project Description

The Coding Lab Management System is a web-based platform designed to streamline coding lab operations by allowing students to receive assignments, write and execute code online, and submit it for AI-assisted review. The superadmin (teacher) manages labs, assigns questions, detects malpractice, and scores submissions.

The Problem Statement

Managing coding assignments, preventing malpractice, and ensuring students receive structured feedback are challenges in a traditional lab setting.

The Solution

A web-based coding lab platform where students can complete and submit assignments while AI reviews code quality and detects malpractice. The teacher oversees all submissions and ensures academic integrity.
